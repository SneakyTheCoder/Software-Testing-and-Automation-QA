**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by frequently testing functions, modules, and whole code. I can also ensure its integrity by performing code reviews and looking for defects and errors. Validating inputs to make sure that all expected inputs are handled correctly as well as, ensuring that all unexpected inputs produce the correct error or provide correct error handling. Using secure authentication via HTTPS is another great way to mitigate risks and ensure that all data transmission are handled securely.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Interpreting user needs involves identifying the problems the system should solve through research rather assumptions. These needs are then translated into specific design inputs, which are then mapped to technical features, prioritized based on impact, and validated through iterative feedback and testing. Understanding the initial problem to be solved can help developers to understand how the system should be communicating within itself as well as which features are deamed a higher proitority than the other features. Testing can help to validate that all requirements are being met to the clients expectation.

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach designing software by first trying to understand the problem that needs to be solved and realizing the problem state. This problem statement can help to identify constraints within the system. The next step in the process would be to identify the core parts of the system like its responsibilities and any boundaries that the program might have. Planning is the most essential step in the development process, plenty of time can be wasted trying to build features and systems that are not inline with the clients expectations. Ensuring that the early stages of planning are well thought out and robust will ensure the quality of your system at the end of the development cycle.
